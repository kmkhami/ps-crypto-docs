# Get Wallet Address

Get a wallet address for a given token. This needs to be for a *parent* account. 

### Request Params

Request a wallet address from Gemini for a given `account`. This endpoint will be hit anytime someone selects a token on the payment page. 

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `account` | string | Yes | The account name of the FBO requesting the address. |
| `token` | string | Yes | The string identifier of the token the FBO wants the address for. |

### Response

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `result` | string | Yes | Whether or not the address creation was successful: ”Success” or “Failure”. |
| `address` | string | No | The wallet address that will be added to the payment page |
| `error` | string | No | Returned if result is “Failure” |


### Leftover Design Decisions

Do we want to store these addresses? I don't think it's necessary, but may be a good idea going into the future for other integrations?
