# Fetch Internal Balances

This tells a merchant what their tax liability is. Idk how this will work, but here are my ideas:

- Aggregate the result of several requests to `fetch-available-balances`.

### Request Params

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `account` | string | Yes | The account to fetch tokens for. |

### Response

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `tokenAmounts` | [`{token`: `amount}`] | No | Array of token balances. |
| `result` | string | Yes | Whether or not the request was successful: ”Success” or “Failure”. |
| `error` | string | No | Returned if result is “Failure” |
