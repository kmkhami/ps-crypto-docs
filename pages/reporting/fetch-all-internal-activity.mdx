# Fetch Transaction History

This shows us a summary for all FBO accounts. Idk how this will work, but here are my ideas:

- Make repeated requests to transaction-history for all FBO accounts in a paginated manner

### Request Params

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `start_date` | string | Yes | The date to start the search for. |
| `end_date` | string | Yes | The date to end the search for. |

### Response

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `responseData` | [] | No | Array of chosen data structure. |
| `result` | string | Yes | Whether or not the request was successful: ”Success” or “Failure”. |
| `error` | string | No | Returned if result is “Failure” |
