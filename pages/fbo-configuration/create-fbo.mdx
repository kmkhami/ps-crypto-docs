### How this works with Gemini high-level

We forward params to Gemini, they return to us a `clientId` and `account` reference string. It is **VERY** important that these are stored.

### Backend high level

Steps: 

1. Forward request to Gemini assuming successful creation of new FBO account. 
2. Create the new FBO account holder in the DB storing their `clientId` and `account`
3. Create a parent FBO account holder using Nelnet's creds mapped to the `clientId` and `account`
