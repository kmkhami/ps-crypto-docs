# Update FBO account

Update an existing FBO account. 

### Request Params

Note: Due to Gemini being bad, all of the same fields for create will be required on their end. I propose making it optional for our API then filling it in when we forward to them.

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `accountName` | string | No | Name of the account. |
| `userEmail` | string | No | Email of the FBO account holder creating the account. |
| `firstName` | string | No | First name of the FBO account holder creating the account. I don't know how this will work with businesses. |
| `lastName` | string | No | Last name of the FBO account holder creating the account. I don't know how this will work with businesses. |
| `address` | string | No | Address of the FBO account holder creating the account. We can break this up into subparams. |
| `DOB` | string | No | Date of birth of FBO account holder. |
| `Phone` | string | No | FBO account holder's phone number. |
| `SSN` | string | No | SSN/TIN of FBO account holder creating account. |
| `userType` | string | No | Can be 'crypto' or 'normal'. Defines whether or not the FBO account holder will be crypto only. |

### Response

| Param | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `result` | string | Yes | Whether or not account creation was successful: ”Success” or “Failure”. |
| `error` | string | No | Returned if result is “Failure” |

### How this works with Gemini high-level

We forward information to Gemini. Gemini will **NOT** change the `clientId` or `account`. 

### Backend high level

Steps: 

1. Forward request to Gemini assuming succesful update.
2. As long as Gemini is succesful, we can update the record in our own db.
